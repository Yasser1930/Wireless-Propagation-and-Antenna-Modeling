# Wireless-Propagation-and-Antenna-Modeling
The project investigates the gradient of signal loss across antenna types and models signal propagation in wireless cellular communications. Using MATLAB simulations, we analyze propagation characteristics for omnidirectional and directional antennas, exploring signal strength variations in different environments to optimize wireless system design.
